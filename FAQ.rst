Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

How do I install this mod?
==========================

This is not a mod. It's a map editor. Do not try to copy any files into
your .jar. Just follow the directions on the :doc:`downloading-running`
page.

I run it, but it just complains that it can't find files.
=========================================================

Make sure to extract all the files from the zip archive you downloaded
and then run it. You cannot run this from inside the zip archive.

When I run it, it just closes the window and does nothing.
==========================================================

If you're on Windows, Make sure you are using the ``launcher.bat``
file. See the :doc:`downloading-running` page.

Can you rewrite this so it generates dungeons on the fly?
=========================================================

No, not really. That would involve rewriting everything in Java and
making a lot of trade-offs for performance.

How can I make my own rooms and traps?
======================================

Learn Python (if you don't know it already) and `Join us on Github
<https://github.com/orphu/mcdungeon>`_! Or, post some ideas in the
`issue tracker <https://github.com/orphu/mcdungeon/issues>`_. If we
like them, we'll implement them!
